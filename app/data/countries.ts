      "Mexico was a bit disappointing for me. I visited Tulum, Mérida, San Cristóbal, and Puerto Escondido — the beaches and cenotes in Tulum were beautiful, but overall the people didn't feel very friendly and the food felt overrated, I never really had a great meal. I was planning to see Chichen Itza but it didn't work out, and I also missed places like Mexico City and Oaxaca, so maybe after visiting them my impression will change.",

      "Bali became my favorite place in Southeast Asia. I stayed in Canggu, Uluwatu, and Ubud, each with its own unique vibe, and also did a guided tour to Nusa Penida. The nightlife was great, the beaches were beautiful, and the people were very friendly. I did get hit with Bali Belly and the next day went snorkeling for the first time — which ended up with me throwing up on the boat and not enjoying it as much as I wanted. The Hindu temples, the rice terraces, the amazing sunsets, and the fact that the island is full of monkeys everywhere made it a place I never got tired of exploring.",

      "Kuala Lumpur was disappointing — not old enough to feel historic and not modern enough to feel exciting. The people came across as a bit rude, and it’s not a place I’d go back to. The highlight was seeing the Petronas Towers lit up at night and walking around the area, which was beautiful. The Batu Caves were also worth visiting, but overall the city felt a bit dirty and didn’t leave a strong impression on me.",

      "Hanoi was chaotic but full of life, with a great nightlife and really good food. Crossing the streets felt like being a kamikaze, but you eventually get used to it. Walking around the Old Quarter and the lakes gave me a different side of the city beyond the chaos. The endless swarm of motorbikes was overwhelming but also iconic, something that really defines the city.",

Visiting the floating village was a unique experience, and overall Cambodia felt very affordable and easy to enjoy. The scale and magnitude of the temples was breathtaking, and it’s hard to put into words how massive and impressive they are.",

      "Thailand was my first time in Southeast Asia, and it was both cheap and unforgettable. I visited Bangkok and Phuket — Bangkok was super fun with a great nightlife, and Phuket had beautiful beaches. I was surprised to see how open weed was, with people smoking at hostels and shops selling it everywhere. The people were very friendly, they spoke English, and getting around in tuk-tuks for the first time was a lot of fun. Visiting the Buddhist temples added another layer to the experience and made the trip even more memorable.",

      "Istanbul is a huge and chaotic city, but fun to visit. The people turned out to be friendly and helpful, even if at first they didn’t seem that way. What really stood out was the mix of cultures — walking through the bazaars, mosques, and lively streets you can feel both Europe and Asia at once. I happened to be there during Ramadan, which made the atmosphere even more special with the night gatherings and the city coming alive after sunset. I didn’t really enjoy the Turkish desserts like baklava, but the tea culture was surprising and a big part of daily life.",

      "Lisbon is a beautiful city with great food, very friendly people, and a vibrant nightlife. It has a unique vibe, with historic places to explore, the famous yellow trams, and amazing viewpoints over the rooftops. I stayed in the Alfama neighborhood, which was beautiful and full of character. Sometimes walking around the Bairro Alto was tiring with all the hills, but it was also fun and lively. I had some rainy days, but that didn’t stop me from enjoying it, and it’s definitely a place I’d love to visit again.",

      "Japan is by far my favorite destination — I'd go back a thousand times. I visited Tokyo, Kyoto, Nara, and Osaka in January, when the cool weather was perfect and there weren't too many tourists. Tokyo was incredible, full of things to do, very modern and high-tech, with a great nightlife. Kyoto was just as amazing but the complete opposite — calm, traditional, and with a historic vibe. I took a day trip to Nara to see the deer, which I really enjoyed. Osaka was disappointing and honestly I wouldn't spend more than two days there, one of them just for Universal Studios. The people were friendly, even if a bit shy, and while not many speak English, I never had trouble communicating. On top of that, it was much cheaper than most people think.",

      "Prague is a beautiful city with plenty to do and a really good nightlife. The historic center is stunning, with medieval architecture everywhere, and just walking around was one of the highlights of being there. Beer culture is huge, and trying the local brews was definitely part of the experience. I walked across the Charles Bridge, which was really nice, though I never managed to go inside Prague Castle. The city also has a lot of steep streets, and walking up and down all the time could get a bit tiring.",

I visited Bucharest and Transylvania in low season — Bucharest surprised me with its beauty, and even had a water park that was a lot of fun. In Transylvania I joined a guided tour, saw snow for the first time, and explored places like Brașov, Peles Castle, and of course Dracula's Castle — which honestly was disappointing.",

      "Sofia wasn't my favorite stop. Coming right after Budapest, the contrast was tough — I went in low season without knowing much about the city, and it felt a bit boring and depressing with not much to do, so I left earlier than planned. People also didn't feel very friendly, which made the experience even less enjoyable. Still, the Soviet-style architecture and gray buildings were interesting to see",

The Christmas market made the city even more special, and its charm really made me want to stay longer. One of the highlights was taking a night boat on the Danube, where I saw the Parliament and bridges beautifully lit up — it was stunning.",

I had a picnic with about 15 strangers under the Eiffel Tower, and after that we went partying — it was a lot of fun. I also visited the Louvre, which was packed with tourists trying to see the Mona Lisa, but I still managed to get to the front and take a good photo. Unfortunately, I missed visiting the Palace of Versailles because I overslept and missed the guided tour.",

Walking around the city was amazing — the Colosseum, plazas, and fountains made the atmosphere truly special. I also visited the Vatican, which was entertaining, though I went with a hangover and very little sleep, so I couldn't enjoy it as much as I wanted.",
